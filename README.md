# Lending Club Case Study
> Given a dataset of loan records having various attributes along with their end status (whether they are fully paid or defaulted). Our objectives are:
1. To identify the risky loan applicants, so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss
2. To understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default

## General Information
With this case study we want to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  So that those can be utilised for risk assessment while considering any loan application. For this we have been provided with a csv file containing around ~39k loan records.

## Conclusions
- Applicants with lower annual income have high chances of doing default on loans as compared to applicants with higher annual income.
- As the interest rate increases the chances of loan default also increases
- Chances of defaults are high when repayment term length is longer than 36 months
- Chances of charge-off is very high in case of small businesses, so due diligence should be performed while considering those loan applications.
- Chances of charge-off are pretty high for the applicants from ‘NE’ state, so we should carefully investigate their applications.
